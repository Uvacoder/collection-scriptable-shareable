A place for sharing and browsing [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app) scripts and widgets.

The project aims to create a place for the community to grow, where people can publish their own creations and find out what others have created: Shareable wants to gather all the scripts that people keep creating and sharing in one, easy-to-use place.

The website is live at [https://shareable.vercel.app/](https://shareable.vercel.app).
